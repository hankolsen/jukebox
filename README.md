# Jukebox

A project originally created in 2011 as a Phonegap app for the release of Don Darling's single [Monster](https://open.spotify.com/album/0T6PC1u52YViVU4VpadBya?si=mZ1oIC7LTd-1lqwg8D9jfw).

I ported it to ES6 just for fun, but as it was created for the screen size of an iPhone 4 it is still only 320px x 480px.
